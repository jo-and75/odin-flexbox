flavor and vibrant color of these eggs. From baking to breakfast scrambles, every dish I make with JAO Farms eggs turns out superbly. Knowing that they come from<br> 
 hens raised with care and attention to their well-being only adds to my satisfaction. JAO Farms has earned a loyal customer in me! - Dorothy, JAO Farms customer

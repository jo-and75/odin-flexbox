I cannot say enough about JAO Farms' yellow yolk eggs! As someone who values quality and freshness in their food, I've been consistently impressed by the rich<br> 
flavor and vibrant color of these eggs. From baking to breakfast scrambles, every dish I make with JAO Farms eggs turns out superbly. Knowing that they come from<br> 
 hens raised with care and attention to their well-being only adds to my satisfaction. JAO Farms has earned a loyal customer in me! - Dorothy, JAO Farms customer
